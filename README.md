# Introducing myself.
I am a first-year student at Hokkaido University, studying under the Modern Japanese Studies Program. One of my hobbies, studying Japanese, has turned into a full-time effort and has been very fulfilling. I have other hobbies though! I like going to caf√©s, taking night walks, and, particularly when I'm in the mood, drawing. This is one of my latest projects.
