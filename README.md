# Introducing myself.
I am a first-year student at Hokkaido University, studying under the Modern Japanese Studies Program. One of my hobbies, studying Japanese, has turned into a full-time effort and has been very fulfilling. I have other hobbies though! I like going to caf√©s, taking night walks, and, particularly when I'm in the mood, drawing. This is one of my latest projects.

## Drawing

I bought a graphics tablet when I was 17, and attempted some drawings, but I only seriously started drawing when I was was in my 20's, following art studies and tutorials online, mostly in 2022 onwards. Most of my drawings are of characters I made for Dungeons and Dragons and play with my friends. My latest character (shown above) is an owlfolk (called 'owlin' after the latest D&D expansions).

### First Drawing

This is another such character, a 'mousefolk' which doesn't exist as a choosable race in D&D, but someone online made a custom module to make the race fit in D&D. As you can see here, I made various sketches. This is after I practiced making simple shapes, and then moved on to drawing a 'simple version' of that character. I say 'simple version' because drawing something from the abstract space of my mind, with the limited skills I had, was tough. I just focused on simple features and tried to nail down some personality traits of the character.
