# Introducing myself.
I am a first-year student at Hokkaido University, studying under the Modern Japanese Studies Program. One of my hobbies, studying Japanese, has turned into a full-time effort and has been very fulfilling. I have other hobbies though! I like going to cafés, taking night walks, and, particularly when I'm in the mood, drawing. This is one of my latest projects.

## Drawing

I bought a graphics tablet when I was 17, and attempted some drawings, but I only seriously started drawing when I was was in my 20's, following art studies and tutorials online, mostly in 2022 onwards. Most of my drawings are of characters I made for Dungeons and Dragons and play with my friends. My latest character (shown above) is an owlfolk (called 'owlin' after the latest D&D expansions).

### First Drawing

This is another such character, a 'mousefolk' which doesn't exist as a choosable race in D&D, but someone online made a custom module[custom module](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Mousefolk_(5e_Race)) to make the race fit in D&D. As you can see here, I made various sketches. This is after I practiced making simple shapes, and then moved on to drawing a 'simple version' of that character. I say 'simple version' because drawing something from the abstract space of my mind, with the limited skills I had, was tough. I just focused on simple features and tried to nail down some personality traits of the character.

### Second Drawing

This is a character I drew for an adventure my friends I played only once. I put him in the game as a dragonborn, a race of humanoid dragons, but his physique and biological structure is that of a sentient crystal. Only his silhouette would look somewhat similar to a dragonborn. This amount of creativity that I am allowed under the rules of D&D, and as allowed by the host of the game, is what I like about D&D.

### Third Drawing

This was my largest and longest project to date. I drew this along Spring 2022. This is a romantic scene between two characters in our game. I learned so much while doing this project, particularly about the different parts of the process of making an artwork: sketching, lineart, coloring, and rendering.

This is something quite different and more simplistic. I drew this as a gift for the owners of a café in Sapporo near my university. I really love going to this café, and the owners are very kind. My Japanese skills are not at a level I desire them to be (always keeping in mind desires vs. expectations), but as my Japanese gets better, I am able to get to know the owners a little bit more each time I go. To thank them for their kindness and patience with me, I printed, framed and gave them this.
